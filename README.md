**Photobooth By Her**

Photobooth By Her is a web-based photobooth that can be accessed anywhere and anytime. This project was inspired by Marisa or commonly known @meshtimes on Instagram who is a product designer at Sans Francisco. The purpose of I designed this website is to train and explore my coding skills through “Vibe Coding,” which is a software development method where artificial intelligence (AI) generates code based on prompting. Here I combine some of my designs with many prompts to produce a product that is exactly the same as what I have designed using figma before. Through Marisa's content, I found that designing a solution from a problem is fun and I shouldn't have to solve a huge problem to start creating a solution.
